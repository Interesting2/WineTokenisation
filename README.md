This codebase is for our thesis project, where I lead the frontend development and design of our website. 

The main research direction of this project is designing and developing a secured platform to trade our own platformâ€™s tokens and use them to buy and sell wines. My contribution as a frontend developer in this project are shown below:
Participated in and contributed in the Requirement Analysis and Architecture Design stages.
Setup the structure of our frontend.
Lead the Design and Implementation of the frontend of our whole system
Contributed to the System Integration and Testing stage by conducting testing for our frontend.


The main achievements made during the course of this thesis project are outlined in this statement.
Creative Integration: Effectively created and put into use a cutting-edge platform that connects contemporary blockchain technology with traditional wine investing. With the help of this platform, wine assets may be tokenized, opening up new avenues for trade and investment.
Platform Development: A user-friendly, dependable, and safe interface has been created to make wine investing easier for people with different degrees of technical skill. To guarantee the platform's integrity and functionality, its robustness was put to the test with great care using extensive testing methodologies.
User Centric Design: Utilised a User Centric design approach, involving potential users in the design process to ensure the platform meets their needs and expectations. This approach led to a highly intuitive user experience and interface.
Research Contribution: By examining how blockchain technology affects conventional sectors and providing a case study of its implementation in the wine industry, the thesis advances both academic and practical knowledge.
Technical Proficiency: Set the standard for upcoming initiatives in the field by skillfully using a variety of contemporary development tools and technologies, such as React.js, useEffect for state management, web3 for smart contract and Metamask integration and Axios for API integration.


Note: The original codebase was set private by a teammate, so i pushed my own code locally to my git repo in the end.
